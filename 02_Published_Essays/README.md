## Long-Form Essays of the Semantic Fidelity Lab

### Overview

This directory contains published long-form essays produced by the Semantic Fidelity Lab. These documents present extended analysis of semantic fidelity, meaning erosion, and language degradation in generative and compression-driven systems.

The materials in this folder are complete essays rather than reference frameworks or
formal theory papers. They develop arguments, clarify distinctions, and examine
implications derived from the lab’s core concepts.

---

### Contents

This directory includes essays addressing topics such as:

- meaning erosion prior to hallucination  
- language as a source of cognitive exhaustion  
- semantic fidelity decay in generative systems  
- distinctions between semantic drift and hallucination  

Each document is maintained as a standalone essay and preserved as a fixed version.

### Role Within the Semantic Fidelity Lab

Published essays serve as the primary explanatory and interpretive output of the
Semantic Fidelity Lab. They translate canonical frameworks and working papers into
accessible analysis while retaining conceptual precision.

These materials examine how generative systems can remain fluent and coherent even
as semantic grounding and meaning preservation weaken.

### Intended Use

- Scholarly reading and reference  
- Citation and academic discussion  
- Conceptual clarification and synthesis  
- Educational and instructional contexts
