# Book Project

## Book-Related Materials of the Semantic Fidelity Lab

### Overview

This directory contains materials related to an in-progress book project associated with
the Semantic Fidelity Lab.

Documents in this folder are excerpts from a longer-form book manuscript and are shared here for reference, continuity, and conceptual alignment with the lab’s research work.

---

### Contents

This directory currently includes:

- Chapter excerpts  
  Selected chapters or sections from the book manuscript that address semantic fidelity, semantic drift, and meaning erosion in AI and language systems.

Each document is preserved as a standalone excerpt and does not represent the full work.

---

### Role Within the Semantic Fidelity Lab

Book-related materials provide extended narrative and integrative treatment of concepts developed elsewhere in the repository.

These excerpts contextualize the lab’s research within a broader argument but are not
themselves canonical frameworks or standalone research papers.

---

### Intended Use

These materials may be used for:

- Contextual reference  
- Conceptual integration with lab research  
- Citation with appropriate attribution to the book project  
- Internal and educational discussion  

They are not final or complete publications.
