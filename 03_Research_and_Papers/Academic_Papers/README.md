# Academic Papers

## Formal Academic Research of the Semantic Fidelity Lab

### Overview

This directory contains academic research papers produced by the Semantic Fidelity Lab. These documents present formal models, analytical frameworks, and research arguments intended for academic citation and scholarly use.

The materials in this folder differ from published essays in that they are written as
academic contributions, with emphasis on structure, definition, and methodological clarity.

---

### Contents

This directory currently includes academic papers addressing topics such as:

- measurement frameworks for semantic fidelity decay  
- formal analysis of meaning erosion in generative systems  
- structural distinctions between semantic drift and hallucination  
- evaluation approaches for compression-driven language models  

Each document is maintained as a standalone academic paper and preserved as a fixed version.

### Role Within the Semantic Fidelity Lab

Academic papers represent the most formal research output of the Semantic Fidelity Lab. They provide theoretical grounding and measurement-oriented structure that support working papers, essays, and applied evaluation efforts.

These materials are intended to contribute to ongoing academic and technical discussions around meaning preservation, evaluation, and generative system behavior.
