# Research and Papers

## Research Outputs of the Semantic Fidelity Lab

### Overview

This directory contains research papers produced by the Semantic Fidelity Lab.
These materials develop, formalize, and extend the lab’s work on semantic fidelity,
meaning erosion, and drift in generative and compression-driven language systems.

The contents of this folder consist of research papers rather than canonical frameworks or published essays. They are intended for citation, scholarly reference, and methodological development.

---

### Contents

This directory includes the following categories of research papers:

- Foundational Papers  
  Early and baseline papers that establish core problem framing, assumptions,
  and conceptual orientation for the lab’s work.

- Academic Papers  
  Formal academic contributions presenting structured analysis, models,
  and measurement frameworks related to semantic fidelity.

Each subdirectory contains standalone, versioned research papers.

### Role Within the Semantic Fidelity Lab

Research papers provide the formal analytical layer of the Semantic Fidelity Lab.
They connect canonical definitions and lexicons to applied evaluation,
benchmarking proposals, and interpretive essays.

These materials focus on clarifying structure, causality, and failure modes
associated with meaning preservation in generative systems.
