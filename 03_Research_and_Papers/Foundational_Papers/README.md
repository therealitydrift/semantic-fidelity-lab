# Foundational Papers

## Foundational Research of the Semantic Fidelity Lab

### Overview

This directory contains foundational papers produced by the Semantic Fidelity Lab.
These documents establish the core problem framing, assumptions, and research direction for the lab’s work on semantic fidelity, meaning erosion, and drift in AI systems.

The materials in this folder define baseline perspectives and organizing questions that
inform later academic papers, working papers, and evaluation frameworks.

---

### Contents

This directory includes foundational papers addressing topics such as:

- early formulations of drift and meaning loss in AI systems  
- initial frameworks for analyzing semantic erosion  
- problem definitions for fidelity-aware evaluation  
- conceptual grounding for later benchmarking efforts  

Each document is preserved as a standalone foundational artifact.

### Role Within the Semantic Fidelity Lab

Foundational papers provide the conceptual starting point for the Semantic Fidelity Lab. They establish shared framing and vocabulary that guide subsequent theoretical,
methodological, and applied work.

These materials clarify what constitutes semantic failure prior to measurement or
formal modeling.

### Intended Use

These materials may be used for:

- Conceptual grounding and orientation  
- Research reference and citation  
- Context for subsequent papers and frameworks  
- Educational and analytical contexts
