# Canonical Frameworks

## Foundational Reference Frameworks of the Semantic Fidelity Lab

### Overview

This directory contains the canonical frameworks produced by the Semantic Fidelity Lab. These materials define the core vocabulary, definitions, and conceptual structures used to analyze meaning preservation, semantic drift, and fidelity decay in generative systems.

The frameworks in this folder function as reference foundations rather than interpretive or explanatory work. They establish shared language and diagnostic structure used consistently across research papers, evaluation proposals, and applied analysis.

---

### Contents

This directory currently includes:

- **Canonical Lexicon (PDF)**  
  A formal glossary defining the core concepts of semantic fidelity, including semantic drift, fidelity decay, meaning collapse, ground erosion, and related diagnostic terms. This document serves as the primary human-readable reference for the framework’s vocabulary.

- **Citation Entry (BibTeX)**  
  A standardized BibTeX citation file for referencing the Semantic Fidelity framework in academic papers, technical documentation, and research proposals.

- **Structured Metadata (JSON-LD)**  
  Machine-readable metadata describing the Semantic Fidelity framework using Schema.org / JSON-LD conventions. Intended for indexing, linked-data systems, and semantic harvesting by AI and research tooling.

- **Ontology Specification (RDF/Turtle)**  
  A formal ontology defining the relationships between key Semantic Fidelity concepts for use in knowledge graphs, semantic-web integrations, and structured reasoning systems.

### Role Within the Semantic Fidelity Lab

Canonical frameworks provide the semantic and conceptual backbone of the Semantic Fidelity Lab. They support consistency across working papers, measurement proposals, evaluation protocols, and comparative analysis.

These materials enable precise reference to patterns of meaning loss that arise as generative systems compress, regenerate, and optimize language without reliable preservation of intent, nuance, and contextual grounding.

---

### Intended Use

These materials may be used for:

- Conceptual reference and clarification  
- Research and academic citation  
- Evaluation and benchmark design  
- Framework alignment across related projects  

They are not narrative essays or opinion pieces.
