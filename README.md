# Semantic Fidelity Lab — Working Papers (2025)

This folder contains two independent research artifacts from the **Semantic Fidelity Lab**, a project focused on mapping and measuring how meaning erodes in generative systems.  
Together, these papers outline the foundations of *semantic drift*, *fidelity decay*, and the broader ecosystem of *meaning collapse* emerging in the compression-heavy environments of modern AI.

Each document stands alone as a distinct contribution and should be cited separately.

## 📄 1. *Fidelity Decay and the Dynamics of Meaning Erosion*

**File:** `SFL-2025-V6-Fidelity-Decay-and-Meaning-Erosion.pdf`

This working paper expands the Drift Protocol by mapping how meaning degrades across four measurable dynamics:

- **Lexical Decay** — high-frequency token hollowing  
- **Recursive Drift** — erosion across paraphrase, summary, or regeneration cycles  
- **Ground Erosion** — collapse of background significance and cultural hierarchy  
- **Semantic Noise** — saturation of low-fidelity synthetic text

The paper argues that the core failure mode in LLMs is not “hallucination” but **meaning erosion**, and proposes early metrics such as the *Semantic Drift Index* and *Fidelity Decay Curve*.

## 📄 2. *The Semantic Fidelity Lexicon: Expanded Definitions for Drift-Age Evaluation*

**File:** `SFL-2025-V7-Semantic-Fidelity-Lexicon-Extended.pdf`

This extended glossary defines the conceptual vocabulary necessary for evaluating meaning preservation in AI systems, including:

- **Semantic Fidelity**  
- **Meaning Collapse**  
- **Fidelity Decay**  
- **Meaning Debt**  
- **Semantic Fatigue**  
- **Ground Erosion**  
- **Semantic Burnout**  
- **Meaning Thinning**

The document serves as both a reference guide and a diagnostic toolkit for researchers, developers, and evaluators working with generative models.

## 🔧 Research Focus

The Semantic Fidelity Lab explores the intersection of:

- **Compression vs. Fidelity**  
- **Drift-aware evaluation protocols**  
- **Cultural distortion under algorithmic optimization**  
- **Detection and measurement of meaning erosion**  
- **Emergent failure modes in synthetic language ecosystems**

All documents in this folder contribute to a unified effort to treat *meaning preservation* as a first-class metric in AI development—alongside accuracy, safety, and coherence.
